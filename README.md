# SolXtence Swap API Examples

Welcome to the SolXtence Swap API Examples repository! This collection of code samples demonstrates how to integrate and use the SolXtence Swap API in various programming languages.

## About SolXtence Swap API

SolXtence Swap API allows you to easily perform token swaps on the Solana blockchain. Our API handles the complex parts of preparing the swap transaction, allowing you to focus on integrating this functionality into your projects.

## Examples

This repository contains examples in different programming languages to help you get started with the SolXtence Swap API. Currently, we have examples for:

- JavaScript (Node.js)
- [Add other languages as you create examples]

Each example demonstrates how to:
1. Call the `/swap` endpoint to get a serialized transaction
2. Deserialize the transaction
3. Sign the transaction
4. Send the transaction to the Solana network
